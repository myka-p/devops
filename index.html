        <h1>Myka&apos;s Spotify Wrapped 2021</h1>
        
        <p>Every end of the year, Spotify creates a playlist of the Top 100 songs you were listening to throughout the whole year. I think it&apos;s really cool, because they put them up by ranking. The ranking is based on how many times you&apos;ve played the song. I&apos;ve listened to various songs by different artists. So, it was a bit interesting for me to see what my Top 10 songs were. Some songs that made it were unexpected, and some were to no surprise. <em>Now, let&apos;s have a look of:</em>  
        </p>

        <h2>My Top 10 Songs of 2021</h2>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>BTS</strong> - <a href="https://youtu.be/WMweEpGlu_U">"Butter"</a></li>
          <li><strong>Agust D</strong> - <a href="https://youtu.be/sHbl6mt6X80">“People”</a></li>
          <li><strong>Agust D</strong> - <a href="https://youtu.be/YZ0Exxdj7YQ">“Moonlight”</a></li>
          <li><strong>BTS</strong> - <a href="https://youtu.be/-5q5mZbe3V8">“Life Goes On”</a></li>
          <li><strong>BTS</strong> - <a href="https://youtu.be/zFT3f9biz68">“Film Out”</a></li>
          <li><strong>Crush ft. Devin Morrison</strong> - <a href="https://youtu.be/9-wG_XKtM1Y">“Let Me”</a></li>
          <li><strong>Agust D ft. RM</strong> - <a href="https://youtu.be/D3bXpqsT0LE">"Strange"</a></li>
          <li><strong>Doja Cat</strong> - <a href="https://youtu.be/88htLIucUdo">“Love to Dream”</a></li>
          <li><strong>BTS</strong> - <a href="https://youtu.be/n_R0-YosZ3g">“Love Maze”</a></li>
          <li><strong>Drake with 21 Savage ft. Project Pat</strong> - <a href="https://youtu.be/XqpQpt_cmhE">“Knife Talk”</a></li>
        </ol>

        <p>As you can tell, <strong>BTS</strong>  and <strong>Agust D</strong>  are obviously my favorite artists. Interestingly, Agust D is a member of the boy group BTS. He is actually known as <em>SUGA</em> in the band, but he goes by Agust D when doing solo projects (sort of his alter ego). I was expecting my summary to be diverse. The most surprising song for me to find on the list is <strong>Drake&apos;s “Knife Talk”</strong>. I didn&apos;t even feel like I listened to it that much. I thought I would see more Doja songs on the Top 10 because I was listening to her album <em>Planet Her</em> nonstop, especially all throughout the summer. But because this was based on the number of times I&apos;ve played the song it makes sense that my Top 10 wouldn&apos;t have that much variety in terms of artists.
